This project aims to build an intelligent recommendation system that suggests videos based on user preferences, watch history, and demographic information. 
By leveraging collaborative filtering and demographic-based recommendation models, the system predicts what users are likely to watch next, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

**ðŸ§  Models Used**
**Collaborative Filtering:**
User-User Collaborative Filtering
Item-Item Collaborative Filtering
Matrix Factorization (Singular Value Decomposition - SVD)

**Demographic-Based Recommendation:**
Uses user demographic attributes (age, gender, location, etc.) to create user profiles.
Clusters users into demographic groups and provides recommendations accordingly.

**Analysis of Dataset:**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns in watch history, user preferences, and content metadata.
Data Visualization: Visualizing distributions of watch times, user engagement, and content popularity.
